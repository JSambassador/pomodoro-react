# Pomodoro Timer

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer application built with React and TypeScript, using Tailwind CSS for styling. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that breaks work into intervals separated by short breaks to improve productivity and focus.

## Features

- 25-minute work sessions (Pomodoros)
- 5-minute break intervals
- Start, stop, and reset timer
- Task list with separate sections for planned and completed tasks
- Add and mark tasks as completed

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:
`npm install`

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server by running:
`npm start`

This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:
`npm run build`

This will create a `build` folder with the compiled assets, which you can then deploy to a web server or hosting service.
